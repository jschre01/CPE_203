The Design Strategy that I used for this project was very similar to Projects 1-5. It is closest to the Strategy Pattern for the search parts, as each entity can interchange between the two algorithms. In addition, I used inheritance with my entities so that I did not have a ton of duplicate code. (Although there is still a good amount). If I had more time on this project, the first thing that I would do is lay out my project smarter, so that there is less duplicate code. I could also be more consistent with a Factory Design Pattern, as my design is inconsistent throughout the project.
